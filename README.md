# nips-papers

I applied the 'louvain' community detection algorithm on NIPS papers.

For running this Python piece of code (without any modifications):
* Go to https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/nips-papers/ and download file 'database.sqlite'.
* Download Python file 'community-detection.py'.
* Set both Python-file and SQLITE database in the same folder

If you don't put them in the same folder, just change the path of the connection.
